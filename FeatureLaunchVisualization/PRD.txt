# Product Requirements Document: World Map Data Visualization Tool

## Overview
A web-based data visualization tool that displays an interactive world map, dynamically coloring countries based on launch status data from a JSON configuration file.

## Product Objectives
- Provide a clear visual representation of global launch status across countries
- Enable quick identification of launched vs non-launched regions
- Support data-driven decision making through intuitive geographic visualization

## Core Features

### Map Visualization
- Display interactive world map with country boundaries
- Color countries green when `launched: true` in JSON data
- Maintain default/neutral coloring for countries with `launched: false` or missing data
- Support pan and zoom functionality for detailed exploration

### Data Integration
- Accept JSON input with country-specific launch status data
- Map JSON country identifiers to geographic boundaries
- Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully
- Support real-time data updates without full page refresh

### User Interface
- Clean, minimal interface focusing on the map visualization
- Legend indicating color coding (green = launched, default = not launched)
- Loading states during data fetch and map rendering
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet viewing

## Technical Requirements

### Data Format
JSON structure should support:
```json
{
  "countries": {
    "US": { "launched": true },
    "CA": { "launched": true },
    "DE": { "launched": false }
  }
}
```

### Performance
- Initial map load time under 3 seconds
- Smooth interactions (pan/zoom) with minimal lag
- Efficient rendering for 190+ countries
- Optimized for modern web browsers

### Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- Responsive design for screen sizes 1024px and larger
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Success Metrics
- Map renders successfully with accurate country coloring
- Users can easily distinguish between launched and non-launched countries
- Tool loads and responds within acceptable performance thresholds
- Data updates reflect immediately in the visualization

## Future Considerations
- Support for additional data properties beyond launch status
- Multiple color schemes or data layers
- Export functionality for generated visualizations
- Integration with external data sources or APIs

## Implementation Notes
This tool is designed for integration with Claude Code and should follow modern web development practices with clean, maintainable code structure suitable for AI-assisted development workflows.
